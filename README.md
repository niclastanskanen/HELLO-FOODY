## Bugs

**Deployment to heroku**

It started with me getting an error when I tried to deploy to Heroku.
After trying to get help on slack, google and YouTube. I contacted Tutor Assistance. The person I spoke to the first time could not help me. So I had to delete the workspace and repositories and start from scratch. I then immediately started connecting to Heroku but with the same error message. I got help on slack and I needed to put in a runtime.txt with a different version of python as heroku doesn't support it. It did not work.
I contacted Tutor assistance again and got help downgrading heroku to heroku-20 instead of heroku-22. It worked until the next day. Then I got the same error message and sought help from tutors again without success.

I got downgraded to heroku-20 and test lots of different python versions in runtime.txt. After 2 days I managed to find version python-3.8-15 which has been working since then.

This has caused me to lose 1 week.

I have tried to clarify all the bugs but have lost order and what is what after all the stress and panic this was done due to the already tight time period.

<br>

### Fixed Bugs

<details><summary>See details</summary>

Heroku deployment bug - fixed with downgrade to heroku-20 from heroku-22 and added runtime.txt with python version - python-3.8.15

### Remaining Bugs
**Bug In restaurant dashboard, edit item.**
I sought help from the tutor because I got error codes when I had my "post" in class "EditMenu"

I understood that there was something wrong with my URL, however I received insufficient help and a reference to follow "Django blog" from LMS. This didn't help as it was probably my URL that gave me the wrong code.
Due to lack of time, this is not fixed.

You can edit items if you have an ID on the product without logging in.

## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on
our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub
   Repository](https://github.com/niclastanskanen/HELLO-FOODY)
1. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings"
   Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
1. Click the button (not the number to the right) and you should now have a copy
   of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

**NOTE**: It is a requirement of the is project that you have Python version 3.8 or higher installed locally.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/niclastanskanen/HELLO-FOODY).
1. Under the repository name, click "Code".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
1. Open your local terminal with git installed
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
1. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```console
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/niclastanskanen/HELLO-FOODY
    ```

1. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/niclastanskanen/HELLO-FOODY
    > Cloning into `test-dir`...
    > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    ```

    [Click here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) for a more detailed explanation of the process above with pictures.

1. Change the current working directory to the cloned project folder (this will be a child directory in the location you cloned the project).

1. It is recommended to use a virtual environment during development ([learn more about virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)). If you would prefer not to use on please skip the following steps:
    1. Create a virtual environment in the projects working directory by entering the following command in the same terminal window used for the steps above `python3 -m venv .venv`.
    1. Before use, the virtual environment will need to be activated using the command `source .venv/bin/activate` in the same terminal window used previously.
1. Packages required by the project can now using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In the cloned directory, rename the file `.env-example` to `.env` and populate it with the information required.
1. Make django migrations using the command `./manage.py migrate`.

### Deploying with Heroku

**NOTE**: It is a prerequisite of deployment to Heroku that you already have access to the following:

- A Cloudinary account, create one for free at [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com).
- An account with an email service that can be used to send confirmations and notification to users.

**NOTE**: It is assumed you have followed all deployment instructions listed in this readme starting with the section titled 'Forking the GitHub Repository'.

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and if not taken there automatically, navigate to your personal app dashboard.
1. At the top of the page locate the 'New' drop down, click it and then select 'Create new app'.
1. Give your application a unique name, select a region appropriate to your location and click the 'Create app' button.
1. Your app should now be created, so from the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Resources' section.
1. Search for 'Heroku Postgres' under the Add-ons section and add it.
1. From the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Settings' section and lick 'Reveal Config Vars' in the Config vars section. Enter the following key / value pairings:
    1. Key as `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and the value as the name of you project with '.herokuapp.com' appended to the end e.g.  `example-app.herokuapp.com`. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `CLOUDINARY_URL` and the value as your cloudinary API Environment variable e.g. `cloudinary://**************:**************@*********`. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` and the value as the password or value provided by your email service of choice. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and the value as the the email address or value provided by your email service of choice. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `SECRET_KEY` and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing. Click the Add button.
    1. Ensure the key `DATABASE_URL` is already populated. This should have been created automatically by Heroku.
    1. The `DATABASE_URL` should be copied into your local `.env`, created during the cloning process.

1. Running migrations on the remote database
    1. Open your local terminal and change the current working directory to that of the project folder.
    1. Make django migrations using the command `./manage.py migrate`.
1. Navigate to the 'Deploy' page using the menu towards the top of the page.
1. Select 'GitHub' from the 'Deployment method' section and you will be prompted to 'Connect to GitHub'.
1. Once connected to your GitHub account you will be able to search for your repository which contains the forked 'Hello-Foody' repository.
1. Once the repository is found click 'Connect'.
1. At the bottom of the page find the section named 'Manual deploy', select the 'main' branch in the drop down and click the 'Deploy' button.
1. Once deployment is complete, click the 'View' button to load the URL of the deployed application.
